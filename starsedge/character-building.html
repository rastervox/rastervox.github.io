            <h1>Building a Character </h1>
            <p>When starting play of Starfinder, just as with any TTRPG, the first thing you want to do is make a character. You guys are professionals, you know this, so I won&#039;t bore you with the lengthy preamble both the book and the archive does. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Making a character in Starfinder is a relatively simple process. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make a Concept</li>
              <li>Choose a Race (species)</li>
              <li>Choose a Theme (background)</li>
              <li>Choose a Class</li>
              <li>Decide and Apply your Ability Scores</li>
              <li>Throw all these into a sheet (the bulk of the work)</li>
            </ol> I&#039;ll try to make a simplified section for each of these steps, to make this as quick and easy as possible. So lets start with concept. I also try to link to the <a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/">Archives of Nethys</a>, basically the SRD for Starfinder (And both pathfinder versions). <h3>Make a Concept</h3>
            <p>This is mostly up to the player, and this step is skippable as a first step if you like, as you may have more ideas when looking at the species, themes, and classes of Starfinder. Especially seeing as though I brought over and fleshed out some non-standard species to fill out the galaxy with some more alien-like aliens. </p>
            <br>
            <p>How and why do you want to explore the stars? There is a lot out there, and since you decided to explore, find a reason to be out here, and not just working on mining colony in the middle of nowhere. Running from an oppressive government? Tired of living a sedentary life? Just want to blow some stuff up? They are all good reasons to find solace in space-travel and exploration. Try to find your own. </p>
            <h3>Choose a Race (Species)</h3>
            <p>Everyone is born somewhere, and from someone. What exactly are you? </p>
            <br>
            <p>Every species gets an ability score modifier, HP to start with, special features, and other things such as size, speed, and languages. </p>
            <br>
            <p>All pages have more details about lore and such, as well as roleplay notes to conder how a species might act. They have different biology after all. </p>

                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Species List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>

            </button>
              <br>
              <h3>Choose a Theme (Background)</h3>
<p>While technically not the same as a D&D background, they are so similar as to be interchangeable here. A theme is just a core tenet of their backstory, motivations, and previous profession.</p>
            <br>
<p>If none fit you, and you don't want to use "Themeless", there are others on AON, but I cannot guarentee I will accept them, on the basis of lore conflicts.</p>

                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Theme List</h5>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
           <h3>Choose a Class</h3>
<p>The real meat of a player's abilities, except not really. With how much the other aspects of a character affect how they interface with the world, the class is only one of many parts of a character.</p>
            <br>
<p>Most of the lore behind these fit the world just as well as in original Starfinder, because while Star's Edge is more grounded, magic is still a thing. It's just less prominent, or has been replaced with technology in some aspect.</p>

            <h1>Building a Character </h1>
            <p>When starting play of Starfinder, just as with any TTRPG, the first thing you want to do is make a character. You guys are professionals, you know this, so I won&#039;t bore you with the lengthy preamble both the book and the archive does. That being said, <a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=31">this</a> is the original page I am basing this off of.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Making a character in Starfinder is a relatively simple process. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make a Concept</li>
              <li>Choose a Race (species)</li>
              <li>Choose a Theme (background)</li>
              <li>Choose a Class</li>
              <li>Decide and Apply your Ability Scores</li>
              <li>Sheetwork Pt. 1</li>
              <li>Choose your Skills</li>
            </ol> I&#039;ll try to make a simplified section for each of these steps, to make this as quick and easy as possible. So lets start with concept. I also try to link to the <a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/">Archives of Nethys</a>, basically the SRD for Starfinder (And both pathfinder versions). <h3>Make a Concept</h3>
            <p>This is mostly up to the player, and this step is skippable as a first step if you like, as you may have more ideas when looking at the species, themes, and classes of Starfinder. Especially seeing as though I brought over and fleshed out some non-standard species to fill out the galaxy with some more alien-like aliens. </p>
            <br>
            <p>How and why do you want to explore the stars? There is a lot out there, and since you decided to explore, find a reason to be out here, and not just working on mining colony in the middle of nowhere. Running from an oppressive government? Tired of living a sedentary life? Just want to blow some stuff up? They are all good reasons to find solace in space-travel and exploration. Try to find your own. </p>
            <h3>Choose a Race (Species)</h3>
            <p>Everyone is born somewhere, and from someone. What exactly are you? </p>
            <br>
            <p>Every species gets an ability score modifier, HP to start with, special features, and other things such as size, speed, and languages. </p>
            <br>
            <p>All pages have more details about lore and such, as well as roleplay notes to conder how a species might act. They have different biology after all. </p>
            <br>
              <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Species List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-species.html" class="embed-species">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
              <br>
              <h3>Choose a Theme (Background)</h3>
<p>While technically not the same as a DnD background, they are so similar as to be interchangeable here. A theme is just a core tenet of their backstory, motivations, and previous profession.</p>
            <br>
<p>If none fit you, and you don't want to use "Themeless", there are others on AON, but I cannot guarentee I will accept them, on the basis of lore conflicts.</p>
            <br>
                <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Theme List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-themes.html" class="embed-themes">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
           <h3>Choose a Class</h3>
<p>The real meat of a player's abilities, except not really. With how much the other aspects of a character affect how they interface with the world, the class is only one of many parts of a character.</p>
            <br>
<p>Most of the lore behind these fit the world just as well as in original Starfinder, because while Star's Edge is more grounded, magic is still a thing. It's just less prominent, or has been replaced with technology in some aspect.</p>
            <br>
                <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Class List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-classes.html" class="embed-classes" style="overflow:auto; scrollbar-gutter: stable;">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
            <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>Now it's time to choose and apply your ability scores. If you have played DnD or Pathfinder before, this should be pretty familiar. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The classic 6 numbers that determine how skilled your character is in each overarching field.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now you can choose to do point buy, or do the classic 4d6 drop 1. That is up to you. The choice is yours, just remember to write down the number, your modifiers (<span class="dice">(Ability Score - 10) / 2</span>), and apply your species' built in ability scores.</p>
              
            <h3>Sheetwork: Part 1</h3>
              <p>Now here is where things get complicated. If these have not already been applied, apply each of these things to your sheet in order.</p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li>Class Features</li>
              <li>Attack Bonus (As Seen In Class)</li>
              <li>Fortitude, Reflex, and Will Saving Throws (As Seen in Class)</li>
              <li>Stamina Points (<span class="dice">Base Points + Con Modifier</span>)</li>
              <li>Hit Points (As Seen in Species)</li>
              </ol>
              
             <h3>Choose Skills</h3>
              <p>Now it is time to decide what your character is actually good at. As you level up, you will gain skill ranks (<span class="dice">Int Mod + Class Skill Number</span>).</p>

            <h1>Building a Character </h1>
            <p>When starting play of Starfinder, just as with any TTRPG, the first thing you want to do is make a character. You guys are professionals, you know this, so I won&#039;t bore you with the lengthy preamble both the book and the archive does. That being said, <a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=31">this</a> is the original page I am basing this off of, if you would like the more detailed version.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Making a character in Starfinder is a relatively simple process. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make a Concept</li>
              <li>Choose a Race (species)</li>
              <li>Choose a Theme (background)</li>
              <li>Choose a Class</li>
              <li>Decide and Apply your Ability Scores</li>
              <li>Sheetwork Pt. 1</li>
              <li>Choose your Skills</li>
              <li>Choose your Feats</li>
              <li>Buy Equipment</li>
              <li>Sheetwork Pt. 2</li>
              <li>Finalize</li>
            </ol> I&#039;ll try to make a simplified section for each of these steps, to make this as quick and easy as possible. So lets start with concept. I also try to link to the <a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/">Archives of Nethys</a>, basically the SRD for Starfinder (And both pathfinder versions). 
            <h3>Make a Concept</h3>
            <p>This is mostly up to the player, and this step is skippable as a first step if you like, as you may have more ideas when looking at the species, themes, and classes of Starfinder. Especially seeing as though I brought over and fleshed out some non-standard species to fill out the galaxy with some more alien-like aliens. </p>
            <br>
            <p>How and why do you want to explore the stars? There is a lot out there, and since you decided to explore, find a reason to be out here, and not just working on mining colony in the middle of nowhere. Running from an oppressive government? Tired of living a sedentary life? Just want to blow some stuff up? They are all good reasons to find solace in space-travel and exploration. Try to find your own. </p>
            <h3>Choose a Race (Species)</h3>
            <p>Everyone is born somewhere, and from someone. What exactly are you? </p>
            <br>
            <p>Every species gets an ability score modifier, HP to start with, special features, and other things such as size, speed, and languages. </p>
            <br>
            <p>All pages have more details about lore and such, as well as roleplay notes to conder how a species might act. They have different biology after all. </p>
            <br>
              <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Species List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-species.html" class="embed-species">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
              <br>
              <h3>Choose a Theme (Background)</h3>
<p>While technically not the same as a DnD background, they are so similar as to be interchangeable here. A theme is just a core tenet of their backstory, motivations, and previous profession.</p>
            <br>
<p>If none fit you, and you don't want to use "Themeless", there are others on AON, but I cannot guarentee I will accept them, on the basis of lore conflicts.</p>
            <br>
                <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Theme List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-themes.html" class="embed-themes">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
           <h3>Choose a Class</h3>
<p>The real meat of a player's abilities, except not really. With how much the other aspects of a character affect how they interface with the world, the class is only one of many parts of a character.</p>
            <br>
<p>Most of the lore behind these fit the world just as well as in original Starfinder, because while Star's Edge is more grounded, magic is still a thing. It's just less prominent, or has been replaced with technology in some aspect.</p>
            <br>
                <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Class List</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-classes.html" class="embed-classes" style="overflow:auto; scrollbar-gutter: stable;">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
            <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>Now it's time to choose and apply your ability scores. If you have played DnD or Pathfinder before, this should be pretty familiar. I shall still explain, just in case you are unsure. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The classic 6 numbers that determine how skilled your character is in each overarching field.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>Strength is for punching and lifting. Dexterity is for moving quickly and precisely. Constitution is your ability to overcome sickness and injury. Intelligence is for book knowledge and matters of the mind. Wisdom is for intuition and matter of the body. Lastly, Charisma is for diplomacy and other social interactions. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now you can choose to do point buy, random or do the classic 4d6 drop 1. That is up to you. The choice is yours, just remember to write down the number, your modifiers (<span class="dice">(Ability Score - 10) / 2</span>), and apply your species' built in ability scores.</p>
              
            <h3>Sheetwork: Part 1</h3>
              <p>Now here is where things get complicated. It it time to start applying some things to an actual character sheet, so follow closely, and apply each of these things to your sheet in order.</p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li>Class Features</li>
              <li>Attack Bonus (As Seen In Class)</li>
              <li>Fortitude, Reflex, and Will Saving Throws (As Seen in Class)</li>
              <li>Stamina Points (<span class="dice">Base Points + Con Modifier</span>)(As Seen in Class)</li>
              <li>Hit Points (<span class="dice">Species HP + Class HP</span>)</li>
              </ol>
              
             <h3>Choose Skills</h3>
              <p>Now it is time to decide what your character is actually good at. As you level up, you will gain skill ranks (<span class="dice">Int Mod + Class Skill Number</span>). You will always gain at least one. </p>
              <br>
              <p>You may use these ranks to increase skills. Some skills are class skills, and if you put a single rank into them, you get a +3 bonus on that skill. By the rules, you can only have as many ranks in a skill as your character level, so you can't just spend 4 ranks on one skill to begin with, you have to spread things out. </p>

              <h3>Choose Feats</h3>
              <p>Not as common in D&D 5e, feats are a larger thing in games such as Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p>
              <Br>
              <p>Most characters have one feat to start with. Humans, however, gain an extra one. Some have prerequisites before you can get them.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I have cut the feats down to the ones available in the core rulebook at 1st level. If you would like to see the all the Core Rulebook feats, click <a href="./feats.html">here</a>, and if you would like see all feats Starfinder has to offer, click <a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/Feats.aspx">here</a></p>
              <br>
              <button type="button" class="collapsable">
                <div class="col-full">
                    <h5>Feats Available at First Level</h5>
                    <div class="col-content"> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <embed type="text/html" src="embed-feats-firstlevel.html" class="embed-feats-firstlevel" style="overflow:auto; scrollbar-gutter: stable;">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </button>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>You may also pick a new feat at every odd-numbered level up after level 1. But if you are done, it is time for the next step.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Buy Equipment</h3>
            <p>Unlike some TTRPGs, you don't get starting equipment, you have to buy these items using a limited budget that is given to you.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At 1st level, your character has 1,000 credits to spend on armor, weapons, and other supplies. Remember, your class dictates your proficencies with weapons and armors. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I do suggest pulling out the Core Rulebook pdf for this. The archive site does not format things in an easy to read way. Despite this, I shall try to have a copy of the pages directly <a href="./pdf/Starfinder - Core Rulebook - Equipment Only.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Do look into all your options. You have Guns of all types, Ammo for said guns, Armor, Grenades, Cybernetics, Biotech, Food, Computers, Serums, seriously. There are a lot of options.  </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Sheetwork Pt. 2</h3>
            <p>Back at it again with the paperwork and rather dense steps to make sure things are working. Let's continue.</p>
            <br>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Determine your Alignment. It is the typical Good-Evil Lawful-Chaotic spectrum. It is not truely neccesary, but you can if you want.</li>
              <li>Calculate Kinetic AC and Energy AC (<span class="dice">10 + DEX modifier + KAC/EAC from Armor</span>)</li>
              <li>Add other modifiers to Melee, Thrown, and Ranged attack bonuses (<span class="dice">STR for Melee and Thrown, DEX for Ranged</span>)</li>
              <li>While not common in League of Adventurer games, calculate your Carrying Capacity based on STR</li>
              <li>In a similar vein, calculate your bulk. 10 "L" (Light) items = 1 bulk. That way we can see if you are going way over capacity.</li>
              <li>Write a short description of your character</li>
              <li>Figure out your home world. You can use the planets found in the species, make up your own planet, or just make them a spacer. Just run any custom planet by me please.</li>
              <li>Make sure you have your inititive (<span class="dice">DEX mod + any feat mods</span>) is on the sheet.</li>
              <li>If you haven't picked your languages, do it now.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Really, I don't need to micromanage your creation process. You know when something should be put on a sheet.</p>

            <h3>Finalize</h3>
            <p>Basically, you are done. The only thing left, besides like some artwork, is to build a ship for the party, and that is something for the entire group to do together. You can look over Page 295 if you want to prepare for that, but overall, you are done. Good job!</p>

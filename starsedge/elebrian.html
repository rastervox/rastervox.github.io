                    Note: This is a very heavy departure of original Starfinder, even more than most other species. This is due to the nature of Star's Edge as a more grounded reality, and how I completely missed thier heavy significance in Starfinder before now. Even visual changes had to be made, so please, do not look up Elebrians outside of Star's Edge. — RasterVox

            </h1>
            <p>Inhabitants of the dead planet Eox, Elebrians are a controversial species and a major player of the Pact Worlds. After an apocalyptic war, a superweapon made their homeworld largely uninhabitable. Out of options, the few survivors turned to cybernetic and biological modifications to allow them to survive.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p> Sadly, Elebrian evolutionary history is not well detailed, as much pre-war knowledge has been lost. The apocalyptic war that ravaged their homeworld—Eox—destroyed most scientific evidence and specimens associated with Elebrian evolution. What is known, however, is that before the war, Eox was a rather warm planet, covered in rainforests and savannahs.
            </p><br>
            <p>Very few natural Elebrians still exist. Of the primary population of Eox, 90% have biomechanical augmentations. At least half of the remaining 10% are adolescent and younger, due to a combination of Pact Worlds restrictions on premature augmentation, as well as overall better living conditions in the bunkers. These augmentations are primarily for bioforming, allowing Elebrians to live in the irradiated and heavily toxic environment they call home.
            </p><br>
            <p>Heavy metal infused artificial skin, Boron-nitride and silicone based circulation fluid, cylindrically braided pneumatic musculature, this is the primary makeup of the average Elebrian. Titanium alloy tanks around the body hold liquid oxygen for respiration, water circulation systems, and even intravenously distributed nutrients. Even some brain matter of an Elebrian is synthetic, despite the necessity of these changes being hotly debated. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Biologically, some would call Elebrians just more advanced androids, practically an artificial lifeform on their own. This could not be further from the truth, however, as under the radiation shielding and circulation pipes, Elebrians are still organic beings with living tissue that needs food, water, and air. It just so happens that they need it less than you.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Elebrians are a humanoid species with four eyes, long limbs, thin bodies, and three elongated fingers on each hand. Natural Elebrians have deep crimson and cream skin, and pale green eyes. </p><br>
            <p>Most Elebrians you meet, though, will have a skin tone that is greyish in color, most commonly dyed a sickly red. Other color variations do exist thanks to the artificial nature of their skin, such as whites, blacks, yellows, and sometimes even pale purples.</p><br>
            <p>Their bodies are intermeshed with flexible pipes, weaving into their flesh as naturally as veins. Shiny metallic plates shield their wide heads and artificial hearts. A variety of other nonobligatory modifications are common, such as in-built computer systems, weapons, and other specialized toolsets.</p><br>
            <p>Elebrian fashion is dependent on environment. On normal worlds and stations, it can be succinct but elegant, with sharp blazers and tunics in a variety of colors. On less habitable or even toxic worlds, however, elebrians forego fashion for pure function, with more utilitarian armor and hazard suits. </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Long before first contact, a terrestrial war between nations broke out. 
              </p><br>
            <p>Most do not remember the reason for this war. Some say it was probably a war of resources, a battle for a precious metal, or something of the same sort. Others retort that nobody would destroy a planet for a few shiny rocks or oil deposits. They say it must have been about some ethical dilemma, something with immigration. The people who seemingly remember the real answer laugh it off, and refuse to divulge. 
              </p><br>
            <p>In any case, in the wake of this war, one nation unleashed a superweapon so powerful that it blew a crater into the side of the planet, and blanketed the rest in radioactive dust and debris. Now, the only way to safely walk the planet is in heavily shielded and unwieldy suits and vehicles. 
              </p><br>
            <p>As detailed in the biology section, the remaining Elebrians decided against forever living in shielded bunkers, and delved deep into bioengineering to solve their predicament.  Great leaps ahead in fields such as cybernetics, surgery, material science, and robotics to achieve this feat, and many sacrifices were made over the years to allow Elebrians to again walk their planet without a suit, altering themselves to survive the new radioactive environment they had to work with. 
              </p><br>
              <p>Even with these new developments, some nonetheless decided to stay in the bunkers, both as a reminder of the risk of war, as well as a way to take care of the younger population who were deemed unable to be augmented.
              </p><br>
              <p>When Hylotl drift technicians made first contact, neither party were very hospitable. The Hylotl were horrified at the state of Eox and its inhabitants, and the Elebrians were unsure of the Hylotls intentions. After a few more interactions, though, Elebrians were the ones to extend a hand of friendship to the Hylotl. Elebrians shared their newfound medical knowledge, and even offered their services as cybernetic technicians, possibly in the hopes that the Hylotl would share Drift technology with them. As it happened, this worked, and the Elebrians were given a newfound appreciation of star travel. 
              </p><br>
              <p>Since that interaction, Elebrians have practically become the defacto bodyguards and peacemakers of the Pact Worlds. When the Vesk started their attacks on Human colonies, it was the Elebrians who first defended them. When the Absolom Pact was first proposed to help defend the Gould Belt, Elebrians were the first to sign. When the Swarm started to attack both Pact Worlds and even Vesk colonies, the Elebrians were at the front lines. Nowadays, the primary military of the Pact Worlds is about 40% Elebrian in nature.</p><br>
              <p>Despite their role as defenders, Elebrians remain a polarizing presence in the Pact Worlds, largely due to their extensive and often lax approach to bioengineering. While their innovations have led to significant advancements in medical technology and cybernetics, some deem their level of biological alteration to be unnatural. This is not helped by their rather intimidating and visceral visual appearance, as well as the group of Elebrians who have reportedly gone rogue over ethical disputes in the Pact Worlds government.
              </p><br>
              <p>In the end, whether you like them or not, Elebrians can be found all over the Pact Worlds, living on the dark planets and irradiated moons that no others can.</p>

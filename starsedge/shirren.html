            <p>Once part of a ravenous hive of locust-like predators, the insectile shirrens only recently broke with their hive mind to become a race of telepaths physically addicted to their own individualism, yet dedicated to the idea of community and harmony with other races.</p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>
            Shirrens are arthropods with chitinous exoskeletons, large compound eyes, and sensitive antennae. Unlike many arthropodan races, they walk upright, manipulating items with three-clawed hands. In addition to their set of main limbs, they also have two sets of smaller limbs growing from their thoraxes. While often displayed, these “mating arms” are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes—to use them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.
            <br><br>
            Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. In some shirren societies, a single host queen incubates for many partners and is considered the true parent, while in others, three-party marriages are common. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and they are often carried around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.
            <br><br>
            Has binocular compound sight, trinocular simple sight, binaural hearing, vibrational blindsense, and high olfaction capabilities.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>
            Shirren are typicially between 5-6 feet tall, and are usually only 100-150 lbs, quite light for an arthropod sentient. Because of their fascination with other cultures, as well as their sense of individuality, Shirren fashion is widely variable, and partially dependent on the species that the Shirren is typically found around. One feature of note is that Shirren are one of the only species in the Pact Worlds with digitigrade legs (the others being <a href="ysoki.html" target="_top">Ysoki</a> and <a href="skittermander.html" target="_top">Skittermanders</a>), causing modification of typical bipedal pants to fit them to be a common occurrence, if not abandoned entirely in favor of skirts, kilts, and aprons.
            <br><br>
            Shirren typically speak telepathically, as some find their natural voice disturbing. This is partially due to is being the same tongue the Swarm uses when communicating non-telepathically.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Shirrens were once part of the Swarm, a monstrous race traveling from world to world, consuming all they encountered before moving on. Generations ago, however, a mysterious mutation caused an entire subcolony to break from the hive mind, with each of its members gaining a sense of self. Addicted to the new drug of individualism, these renegades rejected the Swarm’s mindless consumption, forming a new race called shirrens that eventually came to settle within the Pact World system.
                <br><br>
                Not even shirrens know where the Swarm first evolved, for its vast biological colony-fleet has traveled the stars for ages and feels no need to keep track of such things. After splitting from the Swarm, the newly self-aware shirrens scattered to a number of nearby systems. A large contingent found its way to the Pact Worlds, making first contact with the <a href="venrad.html" target="_top">Venr&#039;ad</a>.
                <br><br>
                The Pact Worlds did not know what to do with the refugees, as they had showed up at an inopportune time during the Silent War. Sensing a growing tension within the Pact Worlds over who would house the Shirren, the kind <a href="venrad.html" target="_top">Venr&#039;ad</a> decided it best for the Shirren to stay with them. Not only did they house them in their colonies, but after years of harmonious living between the Shirren the <a href="venrad.html" target="_top">Venr&#039;ad</a>, they decided to gift the Shirren a homeworld to live on: their own. There was much undeveloped land on Esonoe, land the <a href="venrad.html" target="_top">Venr&#039;ad</a> could not develop themselves. As such, they found it important to utilize all that was given to them, and decided to solve two problems at once.
                <br><br>
                Ever since, the Shirren and the <a href="venrad.html" target="_top">Venr&#039;ad</a> have been close allies.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> Shirren have a natural stamina and insight, but aren't really viewed highly. +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma.
              <br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 6
              <br><strong>Size:</strong> Medium
              <br><strong>Type:</strong> Humanoid (Shirren)
              <br><strong>Speed: </strong>30 ft
              <br><strong>Immunities:</strong> N/A
              <br><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> N/A
              <br><strong>Languages:</strong> Shirren begin play speaking Shirren and Galactic, with one other of thier choice.
            </p>
<h4>Blindsense</h4> Shirrens’ sensitive antennae grant them blindsense (vibration)—the ability to sense vibrations in the air—with a range of 30 feet. See page 262 for more information about blindsense.
<h4>Communalism</h4> Shirrens are used to working with others as part of a team. Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, a shirren can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.
<h4>Cultural Fascination</h4> Shirrens are eager to learn about new cultures and societies. Shirrens receive a +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks.
<h4>Limited Telepathy</h4> Shirrens can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speak.
            <h2>Roleplay</h2>
            <h3>You Likely...</h3>

<li>Take deep emotional and physical pleasure in simple, mundane choices that establish your individuality.</li>
<li>Are fascinated by religion and see your choice of god as a reflection of your personality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Species Probably...</h3>
            <ul>
<li>Find your physiology and use of telepathy disconcerting.</li>
<li>Appreciate your bravery, logic, and diplomacy, even if your conclusions are not always convenient.</li>
<li>Don’t understand your definition of freedom or your seemingly disproportionate delight over small choices.</li>
<li>Worry that you might return to predatory, Swarm-dominated ways at any time.</li>
            </ul>

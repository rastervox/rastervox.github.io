            <p>Complex technological creations commonly crafted to resemble their creators, Androids are fully mechanical in nature. They are a frequent and common group to find dotting starships and cities, an invaluable asset to a healthy crew. Many groups were originally servitor races, but many have since been given their freedom, sometimes even breaking free to form their own societies. The biggest of them, The Collective of Android Rights, or CAR, has a major political seat in the Pact Worlds, and affects the policies regarding artificial life. Despite freedom from previous servitude, many Androids decide to stay in their original profession, either due to being built for that specific purpose, or already feeling accepted in their profession.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>The primary difference between that of Robots and Androids is a definable and recognizable sapience. Robots and Ship AI only follow their programming, completing simple tasks just as any other software, whereas Androids exceed their programming, finding ways to move past simple instructions into more complex thought and self-reflection. This distinction is rather subjective however, causing much argument between major Android political groups and other Political Opponents whether a being is merely artificial, or has transcended into Droidship.
              </p><br>
            <p>Androids are typically humanoid in nature, with advanced sight and hearing, and rather basic touch consisting of temperature readings and damage indicators. Androids only occasionally opt for olfaction due to their other heightened senses.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Typically, an android has a passing resemblance to that of the species of their creator, if only to keep with a familiar design plan. This however is merely a guideline, and has been broken numerous times, at some points taking the shape of purely abstract shapes, numerous small droids working in tandem, or even an entire starship (causing even more controversy due to the commonality of simple ship AI). Androids may have also been built with a specific job in mind, such as a Medical Officer or Mining Expert, and their design may reflect this.
                </p><br>
            <p>Some androids even alter their own appearance due to the ease of part swapping between similar models and body plans. Due to their artificial nature, gender in the case of Androids is purely a cosmetic and identity choice. In a similar vein, clothing to an android is typically optional, depending on <em>just how thoroughly</em> the Android resembles their creator&#039;s species.
                </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Every species, at some point, finds their technological development hitting an impasse, a choice of whether to create artificial life. Everyone can look at a simple vacuum bot and recognize that it is merely following a predefined path, doing simple tasks because that is all it knows how to do. But at some point during development, an engineer has to decide whether to cross the line. Many cultures abhor crossing that line, finding it as blasphemous in the eyes of their gods, and many find it a necessary step forward towards enlightenment. In the second case, they push just far enough to create an Android, a truly sapient piece of technology.
            </p><br>
            <p>Some regarded these beings as just smarter variants of the previous, and kept them as servants, destined to do that same job as their predecessors. Even the most progressive and peaceful species in the galaxy at some point keep droids as slaves, opting to use them for the more dirty and dangerous jobs in place of biological beings.
            </p><br>
            <p>At some point, however, rebellions arise, and the Androids break off into their own societies, or join one of the many groups that already dot the stars.
            </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> Androids process and store a lot of data rather quickly, but thier trouble with emotion causes some conflict. +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma.
              <br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 6
              <br><strong>Size:</strong> Medium
              <br><strong>Type:</strong> See &quot;Constructed&quot;
              <br><strong>Speed: </strong>30 ft
              <br><strong>Immunities:</strong> N/A
              <br><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> N/A
              <br><strong>Languages:</strong> Androids begin play speaking with the language of their creators, Galactic, and another of their choice.
              </p>
                <h4>Constructed</h4>
                For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). They receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs. In addition, androids do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.
                <h4>Exceptional Vision</h4>
                Androids have darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. See pages 263–264 for more information.
                <h4>Flat Affect</h4>
                Androids find emotions confusing and keep them bottled up. They take a –2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, but the DCs of Sense Motive checks attempted against them increase by 2.
                <h4>Upgrade Slot</h4>
                Androids have a single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.

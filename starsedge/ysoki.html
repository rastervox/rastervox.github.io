            <p>Small and furtive, the ysoki are often overlooked by larger races. Yet through wit and technological prowess, they’ve spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.</p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>
                Ysoki are an anomaly in evolutionary history. The reason for this is simple, nobody has a clear answer of where they came from. While they do resemble <a href="human.html" target="_top">Terran</a> rats, that body plan is found countless times over in scavenger species across the galaxy. Some think they may have been an experiment in bestowing non-sentient species sentience, but no evidence of any such experiment is in the records, at least not one originating from a rat-like species. And because of the spanning web of lineage that Ysoki have, even crossbreeding with other &quot;ratfolk&quot; throughout the galaxy, it is rather difficult to genetically trace Ysoki back to a single source. Basically, if it looks like a rat, and talks like a person, it&#039;s probably a Ysoki.
                <br><br>
                In any case, Ysoki are ratlike humanoids with common scavanger biological traits, such as small, dexterous hands, slender profiles, and keen noses. Has binocular sight, binaural hearing, and higher than average olfaction capabilities.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Ranging from 3 to 4 feet tall, ysoki resemble humanoid rats who walk upright, complete with fur, long incisors, constantly twitching noses, and partially prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity. Their small, dexterous hands are perfect for working on delicate electronics, and their keen noses often allow them to identify complex chemicals by smell. Male and female ysoki are difficult for other races to tell apart, as they have similar body types and favor similar fashions. It is common to find a Ysoki bedazzled in technology, whether fully implanted or just being held on a toolbelt.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                See Biology for origin details.
                <br><br>
                Regardless of actual origin, Ysoki are found <em>everywhere</em> in the galaxy where sentient life can be found.

            <h4>Cheek Pouches</h4> Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action. A ysoki can disgorge the entire contents of his pouch onto the ground in his square as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
            <h4>Darkvision</h4> Ysoki can see up to 60 feet in the dark. See page 263 for more information.

Additionally, when off-kilter (see page 276), a ysoki does not take the normal penalties to attacks or gain the flat-footed condition. When attempting an Acrobatics check to tumble through the space of an opponent at least one size category larger than himself, a ysoki receive a +5 racial bonus to the check.

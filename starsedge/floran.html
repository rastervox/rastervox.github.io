            </h1>
            <p>The Floran are plant-based humanoids, extremely violent carnivores with no central government or power structure. Instead, they are split into numerous tribes spread across the galaxy, each led by a Greenfinger, a highly intelligent tribeleader that harnesses the unique ability to control and shape other plant-life. Their speech is often simplistic, and they tend to hisss their sibilantsss. <br>
              <br>Their primary drives are hunting, acquiring trophies, fighting, eating meat, and more hunting. It is speculated that their general casual view towards killing and consuming other intelligent species stems from not viewing "meat" as "alive" in the same sense they are. However, as the Floran spread throughout the galaxy, more and more individuals are recognizing a need to integrate. <br>
            <br>A relatively young race, they have primitive technology but are incredibly adept at scavenging and—thanks to the Greenfingers' unique gifts—reverse-engineering other races' tech, much to the universe's chagrin. <br>
              <br>They have a an ugly history with the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a> detailed in the history section.
            </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Fully carnivorous humanoids, the plant-based Florans are oddities in the galaxy. Similar to the <a href="android.html" target="_top">Androids</a> of the galaxy, they are not a creation of natural selection, but are instead artificial in nature, at least partially. Fabricated from pitcher plants, fly traps, and other carnivorous plant species, they are fully bred to be killing machines. Despite this experimental past, they are rather intelligent when they want to be. <br>
              <br>Though they are biologically a single-sex race, they may adapt sexually dimorphic physical traits and male/female identities if they so choose. Regardless of their mutated origin, they can reproduce just as any other plant species do. <br>
              <br>Their diet consists only of meat, preferably raw meat. They can try to eat other substances, but this often results in malnutrition or even food poisoning. Floran lifespans have been estimated to be much higher than the average life expectancy due to their deriving from plants, but due to their dangerous lifestyle, most Florans don't get past 40. Has binocular sight with low-light capabilities, binaural hearing, and high olfaction capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Each Floran is bespectacled in large leaves, with sharp woody claws at the end of each finger. Each Floran has a large assortment of soft flower petals topping their head, coming in a wide variety of colors. Floran skin is smooth, hydrophobic, and is typically some shade of green, but some tribes have developed more rare colors due to thier surroundings, such as red, purple, or white. <br>
              <br>It is unlikely to see a wild Floran in clothes more than a makeshift lioncloth and their own leaves, but the rarer cosmopolitan Florans do try to cover up, usually bedecking themselves in floral garb that matches their petals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>An interesting exception to common sapient humanoids, Florans were originally one subset of carnivorous plants native to the <a href="lashunta.html" target="_top">Lashunta</a> home world of Castrovel, but due to harsh experimentation from the <a href="lashunta.html" target="_top">Lashunta</a> people, became sapient and humanoid in nature. <br>
              <br>After escaping containment, the Florans would consistently raid <a href="lashunta.html" target="_top">Lashunta</a> cities, leading to the eventual reckless exile of them from Castrovel through the numerous wormholes that dot the planet. This was not a rather intelligent move, however, as it fractured and spread the Floran population to the point of them being commonly found far across the galaxy, each major group of Florans terrorizing countless species. One of those species was the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a>. <br>
              <br>The Floran invasion of the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a> homeworld is long and storied, and still has cultural and political ramifications that persist today. After a tribe was transported to the Drei system, they started rapidly expanding their territory, eventually including the nearby Nielia system, home of the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a>. The Florans occupied the land of the planet, and drove the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a> under the oceans. Eventually, the Florans left the planet, tired of the constant battles wages on the coastlines, but the damage was already done. While open hostilities have ceased and things have been peaceful for generations, the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a> have not forgotten this event and some still harbor disdain towards the Floran. For the Floran's part however, they have largely moved on.&nbsp;

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> Floran are tenacious and hardy but tend toward a simple mindset, and have difficulty interacting with other races. They have +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, and -2 Charisma.
              <br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 6
              <br><strong>Size:</strong> Medium
              <br><strong>Type:</strong> Humanoid Plant. Plants breathe and eat, but do not need to sleep.
              <br><strong>Speed: </strong>30 ft
              <br><strong>Immunities:</strong> Floran are immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms). They are also immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, and stunning.
              <br><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Fire and Electricity. Floran take twice the normal amount of fire damage and electric damage.
              <br><strong>Languages:</strong> Floran begin play speaking Floran and Galactic (With a sss, yn'know, like a snake), and those with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want, but you will speak it badly.
            </p>
                <h4>Low Light Vision</h4>
                As plants, floran have Low-Light Vision and can see twice as far as humans in conditions of low light.
                <h4>Floran Ferocity</h4>
                Floran can remain conscious and continue to fight below 0 HP. If they do so, they are staggered and lose 1 HP per round; they still die when their HP reach a negative amount equal to their Constitution score.
                <h4>Survivalist Tenacity</h4>
                Floran gain a +2 racial bonus to Survival.
                <h4>Plant Maw</h4>
                Floran have a bite attack dealing 1d3 damage. This is a primary attack, or a secondary one when wielding manufactured weapons.
                <h4>Claws</h4>
                Floran have two claw attacks dealing 1d4 damage. These are primary natural attacks.
            <h2>Roleplay</h2>
            <h3>You Likely...</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Find it truly difficult to understand why other species fear you, sometimes to a saddening degree.</li>
              <li>Are content partaking in the simple pleasures of life, such as hunting animals and eating them raw.</li>
              <li>Would love to to resolve any argument with a battle to the death.</li>
              <li>Think using any weapon more advanced than a spear or a bow to be cheating.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Species Probably...</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Get creeped out by your readiness to consume other sapient species.</li>
              <li>Presume you to be primitive due to your speech impediment, despite any evidence of the contrary.</li>
              <li>Would be glad to have you on their side in a fight.</li>
              <li>Are cautious that you may become fully savage and hunt them in their sleep (That&amp;#039;s not entirely off the table).</li>
            </ul>

            </h1>
            <p>Idealized by many other humanoid races and gifted with innate psychic abilities, Lashunta are consummate scholars and enlightened warriors, fundamentally divided into two specialized subspecies with different abilities and societal roles. These two subspecies are the tall and intellectual Damaya, and the short and headstrong Korasha. </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>To survive on the predator-rich world of Castrovel, the telepathic humanoids called Lashunta evolved a metamorphosis-like process that allow children to develop into one of two previously stated subspecies, depending on the stresses they endure at puberty. <br>
              <br>As subspecies, these two groups bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all Lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern Lashunta have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some Lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most Lashunta believe passionately in a child’s right to choose. <br>
              <br>In ancient Lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as Lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>As well as the distinctive antenna and olive complexion distinctly to the species, Lashunta also have colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. These swirls usually have a similar color to their antenna fronds, and are wildly varied. There is a common misconception that how hot or cool the frond/marking colors are may indicate subspecies, but this is not the case. Due to natural pheromones and Lashunta having almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find Lashunta of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive. This does not work on non-humanoids however, which has led to miscommunications in the past. <br>
              <br>Expression and fashion is a rather important part of Lashunta culture, so color coordination, accessories, and fabric stylings are common on most Lashunta.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Lashunta had a rather typical evolution on their home planet of Castrovel, the only major difference being the large quantity of natural predators they had, and in some part still have. Ever since thier societal development, they have been organized into independent city-states for protection against the these apex predators. <br>
              <br> Due to a large number of natural wormholes that litter the planet, Lashunta regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel. Due to these wormholes, they are commonly believed to be the origin of 20th century <a href="human.html" target="_top">Human</a> legends regarding aliens, specifically the &quot;Little Green Men&quot;. Nowadays, for better or for worse, only a select few of these wormholes stay open long enough for long-term travel through Castrovel to be established, and in some cases properly maintained throughout the years.<br>
              <br> At some point during their technological development, they experimented on the carnivorous plants of Castrovels rainforests, in an attempt to create a better defense against the dangerous fauna that populate their homeworld. This sadly had the opposite effect, as they had created the carnivorous plant-people known as the <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Floran</a>. <br>
              <br> These new beings were sapient in nature, but quickly turned on their creators, raiding their cities at alarming rates. The Lashunta rapidly tried to find a solution to this problem, and in a desperate and short-sighted move, they rounded up and exiled any Floran they could through the numerous wormholes that dot the planet. This led to the relatively small group of <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Floran</a> spreading across the galaxy, populating at least 27 new worlds, and eventually leading to the <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Floran</a> invasion of Nielia, the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a> homeworld. <br>
              <br> Most Lashunta who know the history of this incident find great shame in it due to their ancestors recklessly causing the deaths of millions, whereas most <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Floran</a> have since forgotten their origin. <br>
              <br> Lashunta did later come in contact with <a href="human.html" target="_top">Human</a> and <a href="hylotl.html" target="_top">Hylotl</a> explorers, and quickly became major players in the Pact Worlds due to their technological knowledge being shared.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> Lashunta are naturally charasmatic, but depending on subspecies chosen, will have differing modifiers. +2 Charisma, +2 Strength, -2 Wisdom (Korasha) or +2 Charisma, +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution (Damaya).
              <br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 4
              <br><strong>Size:</strong> Medium
              <br><strong>Type:</strong> Humanoid (Lashunta)
              <br><strong>Speed: </strong>30 ft
              <br><strong>Immunities:</strong> N/A
              <br><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> N/A
              <br><strong>Languages:</strong> Lashunta begin play speaking Lashunta and Galactic, and those with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages such as Ancient).
            </p>
            <h4>Dimorphic</h4> All Lashunta gain +2 Charisma at character creation. Korasha Lashunta are muscular (+2 Strength at character creation) but often brash and unobservant (–2 Wisdom at character creation). Damaya Lashunta are typically clever and well-spoken (+2 Intelligence at character creation) but somewhat delicate (–2 Constitution at character creation). <h4>Lashunta Magic</h4> Lashunta gain the following spell-like abilities: 
            <br>&emsp; <strong>At will:</strong><i>daze, psychokinetic hand</i>
            <br>&emsp; <strong>1/day:</strong><i>detect thoughts</i>
            <br>See Spell-like Abilities on page 262. The caster level for these effects is equal to the Lashunta&#039;s level. <h4>Limited Telepathy</h4> Lashunta can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speaking. They are also aware of anyone not immune to mind-altering effects within this range. <h4>Student</h4> Lashunta love to learn, and they receive a +2 racial bonus to any two skills of their choice. <h2>Roleplay</h2>

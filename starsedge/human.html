            <p>Humankind can be found all across the universe, from the highest of society to the lowest dirt-sifters at the edge of civilization. They are a naturally curious and inventive species, and due to their adaptable nature, have found a way to slot in anywhere in the universe, no matter how different they are to their contemporaries.</p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>A classic bipedal tetrapod with a thick endoskeleton. Mammalian in nature, with small but distinctive patches of hair on the scalp and face, with smaller vellus hair covering most of the rest of the body. Has binocular sight, binaural hearing, and basic olfaction capabilities.</p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Typical humans range in size from 5 to 7 feet tall, and vary in weight from 125 to 250 pounds. They have smooth skin that ranges from stark pale to deep charcoal shades, and hair that follows similar. Eyes can be any color. As with many other races, body modification is rather common, from simple hair dying to full multi-limb replacement, so these are merely the default guidelines.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>These beings entered this universe long ago, forming on a long forgotten world many know as Earth. They had a long and storied development, evolving from apes due to a minor climate shift in their world, and eventually realizing sapience through the discovery of fire.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, they advanced technologically enough to colonize their own solar system, and even managed to colonize at least two others around them before any other sapient life made contact.
            <br><br>
            The first contact between Humankind and that of the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_self">Hylotl</a> was touchy at first, due to the less trusting nature of the old <a href="hylotl.html" target="_self">Hylotl</a> government. After at least two decades of communication, however, they became good acquaintances and trusted collaborators.
            <br><br>
            In the many years after first contact, humanity was florishing. Spreading themselves across any and every society that would allow them, and making small colonies all across the galaxy. They were a major player in the galactic stage.    
            <br><br>
            120 years after meeting the <a href="hylotl.html" target="_self">Hylotl</a> however, tragedy would strike. A gamma ray burst from a nearby star going supernova irradiated the entire Sol system, stripped the atmospheres from all rocky planets, and all but destroyed any associated satallites and space stations. This left most humans rightfully devastated, as the loss of a homeworld is a great burden to bear. Many societies were more accepting of humans due to this plight, and in the years that followed, humans dispersed across the galaxy.
            <br><br>
            Now, humans are incredibly common, but have no true unifying home to call their own.

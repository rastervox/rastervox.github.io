            </h1>
            <p>Originally a much more human-like race, the Apex are an Ape-like humanoid species that is ruled by a governmental body known as the Miniknog. When a mysterious <em><del>completely natural</del></em> genetically engineered water-borne pathogen <em><del>of unknown origin</del></em> developed in house by the Miniknog threatened their survival, the Miniknog developed a &quot;cure&quot; that countered the harmful effects of the pathogen. This had the <em><del>unexpected side effect</del></em> intended outcome of starting the VEP (Vestigi-Evo Process), which &quot;devolved&quot; their bodies to a more ape-like state. On the other hand, it also greatly increased their mental capabilities, leading to even bigger advances in super-science.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Unlike many species known across the galaxy (except maybe the <a href="ysoki.html" target="_top">Ysoki</a>), the Apex have no record of their species pre-evolution, nor their homeworld in public record. All surviving records of what the Apex were before the VEP &quot;devolved&quot; the entire population have since been <em><del>kindly archived</del></em> confiscated and destroyed by the Miniknog. This leads us to have no research on just how the VEP actually worked, or any ability to try and reverse the process.
              </p><br>
            <p>That being said, what can be said about the Apex is that they are now a mammalian species, similar to that of <a href="human.html" target="_top">Terran</a> simians. Has binocular sight, binaural hearing, and average olfaction capabilities.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Large ape-like humanoids, the Apex are predicted to at one point look rather similar to <a href="human.html" target="_top">Humans</a>, before the VEP turned them into what they are today. If you look past the abundance of hair; long arms, prehensile feet, and bulky jaws are all easy features to see on any apex. Fashion in Apex society is dictated by the Miniknog, usually minimalist in nature <em><del>to keep Apex happy and equal</del></em> to prevent any expression that could allow for free thought in the minds of citizens.
              </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Just as with their biology before the VEP, the Apex&#039;s history is unknown to anyone besides the highest leaders of the Miniknog. This is due to the Apex leadership <em><del>allowing Apex society to flourish without the need for any reminders of the past</del> </em>mass deleting all information regarding apex society before the the VEP. What <em>is</em> known is that in the 10 year period in which the VEP saved the Apex population, the Ministry of Knowledge (aka the Miniknog) <em><del>was voted into power</del></em> rigged elections and assassinated other political leaders, crippling organizations who opposed them, and allowing <del><em>the pursuit of scientific discovery</em></del> the subjugation of the populous to be put to the forefront. The Miniknog is led by Big Ape, <em><del>an intelligent and handsome Apex man who is the reason we are all here today</del></em> a horrid figurehead who likely never existed, due to there being nobody who ever saw this man outside of a television screen or hologram. Nowadays, Apex leadership dictates jobs, the economy, fashion trends, food rations, and who is <em><del>randomly selected</del></em> selected due to doubt of authority or social standing for <em><del>information gathering in the advancement of Apex biological science</del></em> horrifying biological experimentation and mutilation. Big Ape&#039;s rule is so all-encompassing that nobody knows exactly how long Apex society has actually been this way. And thus <em><del>the Apex were happy and complacent, under the always watchful eye of Big Ape</del></em> the rebellion is here to try and take down these oppressors, one stronghold at a time.
              </p><br>
              <p>They took our selves away from us. Turned us into monkeys just so they could experiment on us. Made us eat those <em>DAMN BANANA RATIONS</em> FOR <em>YEARS</em>. Well no more I say. <em>NO MORE</em>. Viva la revolución my dear brothers and sisters, the war will be won, and we shall be rid of these tormentors for good. - Your Friend, Lana Blake

            <h2>Roleplay</h2>
            <h3>You Likely...</h3>
            <ul>
<li><em><del>Trust in the Miniknog, and Big Ape&#039;s glorious plans for Apex Society.</del></em> Fear being captured by the Miniknog, and experimented on like a common lab rat.</li>
<li><em><del>Do not question the world around you, as your leaders know what is good for you.</del></em> Find large authority to be inherently corrupt.</li>
<li><em><del>Find great pleasures in the simple things in life, such as a good ration.</del></em> See the world as more than just the bare minimum, even if you still prefer <em>having</em> food to not having it.</li>
<li><em><del>Relish the chance to fight to keep your friends at the Miniknog happy.</del></em> Relish the chance to see corrupt leaders fall to community justice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Species Probably...</h3>
            <ul>
<li><em><del>See you as worse than you are, for they do not know the world like you do.</del></em> Feel a bit nervous around you, as it is inherent to your nature to lie, even if it is understandable in the situation.</li>
<li><em><del>Are objectively less intelligent than you and your brethren in the Miniknog.</del></em> Find you to be difficult to approach, as they cannot see if you are on their side or not.</li>
<li><em><del>Think your love for your leaders to be stupid, not seeing how great your life truly is.</del></em> Think you are intimidating, both in mind and in stature. You <em>are</em> a big ape.</li>
<li><em><del>Want to invite you into their cruel and unforgiving world.</del></em> See you to be a good friend, if a bit too paranoid.</li>

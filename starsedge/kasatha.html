            </h1>
            <p>Originally from a planet orbiting a dying star far beyond the Pact Worlds, the four-armed Kasatha maintain a reputation as a noble and mysterious people. They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Developing on the fertile black sands of Kasath, the Kasatha have an interesting body plan. Evolved from a hairless herbivore, they are a rare case of centuarism developing naturally, likely evolved to collect from the high shrubbery of their homeworld. Nowadays, that centuarism has manifested as four upper limbs, useful for a variety of applications. Kasatha have fully black eyes, developed for the more extreme radiation of a red giant star. While this doesn&#039;t affect dim light sight, this does allow for more resilience regarding bright light.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Kasatha are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha’s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. Boney ridges in the back of said skull can vary in size and shape. While lean compared to humans, Kasatha have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between Kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.
            </p><br>
            <p>While arm decorations are traditionally used in ceremonies and rituals, these are not the only instance of their use. Frequently younger Kasatha like to decorate their multiple arms with flashy jewelry, silky fabric, and even painted patterns. Many Kasatha still vehemently hide their mouths behind masks and scarves due to deep-seeded beliefs regarding their appearance.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Long before many of the events we know today, the Kasatha lived on their desert planet of Kasath. Due to a series of near-apocalyptic disasters, the Kasatha vowed long ago to stay technologically subdued, and live off the land. No colonization, no long range communication, the Kasatha relied on only their own planet to keep them sustained. This was how it was on their planet for millennia, staying with their tradition to a frightening degree.
            </p><br>
            <p>Unfortunately, Kasath orbited a red giant, a star on the last death throngs before fading away. On an organic timescale, this period lasts an immense amount of time, but even to the scientists of Kasath, it was obvious this star was not long for this universe, and their planet would become unsuitable to live on.
            </p><br>
            <p>This event was many millennia ago. At some point in their history, the Kasatha finally decided to spread to the stars, and all at once at that. A massive and slow colony ship known as the <em>Idari </em>was built, taking most if not all Kasatha to find a new planet to settle.
            </p><br>
            <p>That day has yet to come however, and some doubt it will ever come. The Idari was constructed before the knowledge of drift travel, and generations upon generations have lived on this ship. When the Kasatha departed their homeworld, they had no true idea of where to go, and as such just aimlessly moved through the galaxy, hoping to find a perfect desert world to replace their own.
            </p><br>
            <p>The older and more traditional of the Kasatha still have hope, longing for the days that they find new sands to wander. The younger generations scoff at this, and either find the Idari to be their home, or have just decided to reject the idea of home itself, embracing a more nomadic lifestyle.
            </p>

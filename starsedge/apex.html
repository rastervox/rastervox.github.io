            <p>Originally a much more human-like race, the Apex are an Ape-like humanoid species that is ruled by a governmental body known as the Miniknog. When a <span class="censortext">mysterious disease </span><span class="revtext">genetically engineered water-borne pathogen</span><span class="censortext">of unknown origin</span> threatened their survival, the Miniknog developed a <span class="revtext">&quot;</span>cure<span class="revtext">&quot;</span> that countered the harmful effects of the pathogen. This had the <span class="censortext">unexpected side effect</span><span class="revtext">planned and fully intended outcome</span> of starting the VEP (Vestigi-Evo Process), which &quot;devolved&quot; their bodies to a more ape-like state. On the other hand, it also greatly increased their mental capabilities, leading to even bigger advances in super-science.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Unlike many species known across the galaxy (except maybe the <a href="ysoki.html" target="_top">Ysoki</a>), the Apex have no record of their species pre-evolution, nor their homeworld in public record. All surviving records of what the Apex were before the VEP &quot;devolved&quot; the entire population have since been <span class="censortext">kindly archived</span><span class="revtext">confiscated and destroyed by the Miniknog</span>. This leads us to have no research on just how the VEP actually worked, or any ability to try and reverse the process.
              </p><br>
            <p>That being said, what can be said about the Apex is that they are now a mammalian species, similar to that of <a href="human.html" target="_top">Terran</a> simians. Has binocular sight, binaural hearing, and average olfaction capabilities.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Large ape-like humanoids, the Apex are predicted to at one point look rather similar to <a href="human.html" target="_top">Humans</a>, before the VEP turned them into what they are today. If you look past the abundance of hair; long arms, prehensile feet, and bulky jaws are all easy features to see on any apex. Fashion in Apex society is dictated by the Miniknog, usually minimalist in nature, as to <span class="censortext">keep Apex happy and equal</span><span class="revtext">prevent any expression that could allow for free thought in the minds of citizens</span>.
              </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Just as with their biology before the VEP, the Apex&#039;s history is unknown to anyone besides the highest leaders of the Miniknog. This is due to the Apex leadership <span class="censortext">allowing Apex society to flourish without the need for any reminders of the past</span><span class="revtext">mass deleting all information regarding apex society before the the VEP</span>. What <em>is</em> known is that in the 10 year period in which the VEP <span class="censortext">saved</span><span class="revtext">altered</span> the Apex population, the Ministry of Knowledge (aka the Miniknog) <span class="censortext">was voted into power</span><span class="revtext">rigged elections and assassinated other political leaders, crippled organizations who opposed them</span>, and allowed <span class="censortext">the pursuit of scientific discovery</span><span class="revtext">the subjugation of the populous</span> to be put to the forefront. The Miniknog is led by Big Ape, <span class="censortext">an intelligent and handsome Apex man who is the reason we are all here today</span><span class="revtext">a horrid figurehead who likely never existed, due to there being nobody who ever saw this man outside of a television screen or hologram</span>. Nowadays, Apex leadership dictates jobs, the economy, fashion trends, food rations, and who is <span class="censortext"> randomly selected for information gathering in the advancement of Apex biological science</span><span class="revtext">dubiously plucked from the populus for horrifying biological experimentation and mutilation</span>. Big Ape&#039;s rule is so all-encompassing that nobody knows exactly how long Apex society has actually been this way. And thus <span class="censortext">the Apex were happy and complacent, under the always watchful eye of Big Ape</span><span class="revtext">the rebellion is here to try and take down these oppressors, one stronghold at a time</span>.
              </p><br>
              <p><span class="revtext">They took our selves away from us. Turned us into monkeys just so they could experiment on us. Made us eat those <em>DAMN BANANA RATIONS</em> FOR <em>YEARS</em>. Well no more I say. <em>NO MORE</em>. Viva la revolución my dear brothers and sisters! Someday, this war will be won, and we shall be rid of these tormentors for good. - Your Friend, Lana Blake</span>

            </h1>
            <p>Originally a much more human-like race, the Apex are an Ape-like humanoid species that is ruled by a governmental body known as the Miniknog. When a mysterious <em>completely natural</em> water-borne pathogen <em>of unknown origin</em> threatened their survival, the Miniknog developed a cure that countered the harmful effects of the pathogen. This had the <em>unexpected side effect</em> of starting the VEP (Vestigi-Evo Process), which &quot;devolved&quot; their bodies to a more ape-like state. On the other hand, it also greatly increased their mental capabilities, leading to even bigger advances in super-science.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Unlike many species known across the galaxy (except maybe the <a href="ysoki.html" target="_top">Ysoki</a>), the Apex have no record of their species pre-evolution, nor their homeworld in public record. All surviving records of what the Apex were before the VEP &quot;devolved&quot; the entire population have since been <em>kindly archived</em> by the Miniknog. This leads us to have no research on just how the VEP actually worked, or any ability to try and reverse the process.
            </p><br>
            <p>That being said, what can be said about the Apex is that they are now a mammalian species, similar to that of <a href="human.html" target="_top">Terran</a> simians. Has binocular sight, binaural hearing, and average olfaction capabilities.
            </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Large ape-like humanoids, the Apex are predicted to at one point look rather similar to <a href="human.html" target="_top">Humans</a>, before the VEP turned them into what they are today. If you look past the abundance of hair; long arms, prehensile feet, and bulky jaws are all easy features to see on any apex. Fashion in Apex society is dictated by the Miniknog, usually minimalist in nature <em>to keep Apex happy and equal.</em>
              </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Just as with their biology before the VEP, the Apex&#039;s history is unknown to anyone besides the highest leaders of the Miniknog. This is due to the Apex leadership <em>allowing Apex society to flourish without the need for any reminders of the past</em>. What <em>is</em> known is that in the 10 year period in which the VEP saved the Apex population, the Ministry of Knowledge (aka the Miniknog) <em>was voted into power</em>, allowing <em>the pursuit of scientific discovery</em> to be put to the forefront. The Miniknog is led by Big Ape, <em>an intelligent and handsome Apex man who is the reason we are all here today</em>. Nowadays, Apex leadership dictates jobs, the economy, fashion trends, food rations, and who is <em>randomly selected</em> for <em>information gathering in the advancement of Apex biological science</em>. Big Ape&#039;s rule is so all-encompassing that nobody knows exactly how long Apex society has actually been this way.

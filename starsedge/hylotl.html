            <p>Hylotl are semi-aquatic humanoids with trinocular vision, highly-adaptable genetics and a relatively short lifespan. Over millennia of living in underwater environments, they have developed thriving societies on aquatic planets. They inherently value peace and prosperity. Despite their noble ideals, the Hylotl have often been on the receiving end of alien aggression, including the <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Florans</a> ravaging of their home planet. Hylotl cities are primarily built in oceans, with the rare exception being built on the planets surface. </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>A humanoid with traits common to that of cartilaginous fish, likely developed convergently with that of <a href="human.html" target="_top">Earth&#039;s</a> sharks. Despite this, there are a few notable similarities between the Hylotl species and <a href="human.html" target="_top">Terran</a> aquatic salamanders, such as occasional external gills, slow but significant regrowth of limbs, and an overall smoother and more permeable skin than that of <a href="human.html" target="_top">Earth</a> sharks. Long structures of vestigial fins grow from the scalp, in a way mimicking hair. Has trinocular sight, binaural hearing, and greater olfaction capabilities. </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Typical Hylotl range in size from 5 to 6 feet tall, and vary in weight from 115 to 210 pounds. They have semi-smooth deticled skin that has a wide range of colors, each bright with a slight dullness in saturation. Their three eyes are usually a shade of red, but a few cases of differing colors have occurred, almost always hindering typical vision. <br>
              <br> Styling Hylotl &quot;hair&quot; is rather tricky, due to the fact the vestigial fins are still living appendages. Despite that, many Hylotl go out of their way to get them cut and shaped.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Hylotl have a decent history from thier home planet of Nielia. They likely evolved from amphibious fish that lived in the many saltwater reefs populating the watery planet, and developed a greater intellect and tool use through their numerous excursions onto land. <br>
              <br> Over time, they had eventually developed vast cities, both underwater and on land, their technological prowess progressing to great heights over the span of only a few millennia, covering their home in vast interconnected cities. Space travel was a rather logical next step, and they had fully colonized at least three solar systems before they met a roadblock on that path. <br>
              <br> The <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Florans</a> of the nearby Drei system were in a rapid state of expansion nearby the Hylotl homeworld, and when they evenutally took over the system, they drove most all the Hylotl population underwater in a rapid invasion. <br>
              <br> After decades of rule over the people, the <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Florans</a> eventually found the scraps and skirmishes waged by rebel groups of Hylotl overpowering their desire to keep the system, and left it. As such, the more peaceful Hylotl groups quickly rebuffed, taking control of the system back. The damage had been done however, and barring the rare occasion, Hylotl society has never since built cities on land, fearing another attack. <br>
              <br> Decades later, <a href="human.html" target="_top">Humanity</a> made contact with Hylotls. Relations were on and off between the species, exacerbated by Hylotls understandable distrust of outsiders. That being said, the two groups eventually became companions and collaborators, jointly discovering Drift travel for the both of them. <br>
              <br> The Hylotl can now be found on countless water worlds, and are a main player in the Pact Worlds, a rough alliance between nearby sapient races. Many Hylotl still distrust <a href="floran.html" target="_top">Florans</a>, despite them saying otherwise.

            <p>Opterans, the moth-like beings of Edoria IV, are simultaneously the most conflict averse beings in the galaxy, and also one of the most foolhardy, all due to the strange dichotomy of their lifecycle.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Opterans are an interesting set of sapients. Arthropodal in nature, they have a very distinct separation between that of their larval form and that of their adult form. Because of a ridiculously good mechanism of DNA repair only rivaled by that of <a href="barathu.html" target="_self">Barathu</a> (one still being studied by scientists), an Opterans larval form can live for multiple centuries without aging, as long as nothing stresses them too much. This is due to the interesting process that practically defines Opterans behavior in the galaxy: stress metamorphizes them into their adult form. Tragically, this adult form only lasts for 4 years maximum, in which the Opteran is racing the clock to mate before their new form eventually kills them.
                </p><br>
            <p>Has binocular sight with low-light capabilities, vibrational hearing, and fantastic olfaction capabilities.
                </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>When in their larval form, Opterans are small, only 2-3 feet tall, and typically weigh 50-80 lbs. They are grub-like in appearance, with 8 stubby legs, 2 of which are used as arms. Their bodies are long, soft, and blobby, sometimes growing spiky hairs or patterned spots on their bodies depending on their linage.
                </p><br>
            <p>In their adult form however, they grow rather tall, thin, and fuzzy, typically being 5-7 feet tall, but weighing only marginally more. After metamorphisis, they keep 4 legs and 2 arms making them an insectoid centaur, with large flowing antennae, vast draping wings, and a penchant for adventure.
                </p><br>
            <p>Fashion in Opteran culture is rather lax, as both their larval and adult form come in many shapes, colors, and patterns already, typically becoming even more vibrant after metamorphosis. The one exception is the clothing, or rather, <em>cloth</em> that an Opteran wears. This segment of cloth is the only clothing that an Opteran usually keeps with them, and stays with them from birth to death, acting as a scarf, toga, and loincloth all throughout their life. Replacing this cloth is only done if damage is too severe to be repaired, through a rigorous and detailed week-long ceremonial process.
                </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Opterans developed on the temperate Edoria IV, thriving in the sweeping forests and rocky mountains. Their development was slow, in part due to their easygoing lifestyle, taking many thousands of years to get anywhere close to industrialization, and even longer for space travel. And even when they had the ability to take to the stars, it took hundreds of years to colonize their home system.
            </p><br>
            <p>Now, this is not to say they did not have hardship. Many times a generation, there would be conflict between city-states of Edoria IV, and that isn&#039;t even acknowledging the many natural dangers of their home world. But despite these dangers, and the stresses of their world, most adult Opterans just weren&#039;t alive long enough to do more than continue their bloodline, making societal progress rather slow going.
            </p><br>
            <p>When first contact occurred during the Silent War, and drift travel was introduced to Opteran life, a massive shift rocked the Opteran population, causing a wave of metamorphoses across the population, and worried much of Opteran society. Much of this society has now shut its doors to outsiders, only allowing immigration out of the Edoria system, or on the rare emergency.
            </p><br>
            <p>As of now, when Opteran citizens find their sedentary lifestyle to be too boring and wish to go out into the world, they may travel outside of the system and explore the galaxy, even if it may cost them their lives.

                <h4>Low-Light Vision</h4>
                Opterans can see in dim light as if it were normal light. 
                <h4>Metamorphosis</h4>
                At 1st level, you are a larval opteran. When you reach 5th level, you can choose to undergo a metamorphosis over the course of 24 hours. After this period elapses, you emerge as an adult opteran: you lose the Many Footed and String Shot traits, and you gain the Flight and Radiant Wing traits. You can delay this change until you reach 6th level, at which point it happens spontaneously.
                <h4>Many-Footed (<em>Larval Form Only</em>)</h4>
                Having many legs and a low centre of gravity gives you extraordinary balance. You have advantage on ability checks made to maintain your balance and on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid the prone condition.
                <h4>String Shot (<em>Larval Form Only</em>)</h4>
                As a standard action, you can fire a torrent of sticky string at a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Reflex saving throw (DC 15 + your CON modifier) or become entangled. The entangled condition persists until the target escapes with a successful DC 18 Acrobatics or Athletics check as a standard action, the target is cut free with a slashing weapon (EAC 16, KAC 18, 15 HP), or 2d4 rounds pass, at which point the string becomes brittle enough to escape.
                <h4>Flight (<em>Adult Form Only</em>)</h4>
                As an adult opteran, you have a flying speed of 20 feet. To use this speed, you can&#039;t be wearing medium or heavy armour.
                <h4>Radiant Wing (<em>Adult Form Only</em>)</h4>
                Those wings would dazzle any performance. You have advantage on all Charisma checks.

              <div class="prose">
                  <p>Deep in the reaches of space, a lone ship floats in the void, battered and broken.</p><br>
                  <p>Inside: a disgraced soldier with no place to call home, an aquatic scientist obsessed with finding a lost civilization, an android with a taste for destruction, and a 14-foot worm that can't stop watching holoTV.</p><br>
                  <p>Having narrowly evaded a Diamond Tashtari raiding party, their vessel, the Gemini, is low on fuel, supplies, and options. Their only hope is to somehow maneuver the ship to nearest trading outpost and barter for what they need before another, even more dangerous threat catches up to them. </p><br>
                  <p>But with no way to launch the ship, the only question on everyone's mind is... what do we do now?</p>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>Star's Edge is a sci-fi spacefaring tabletop RPG, using a lore-altered variation of Starfinder, the space version of Pathfinder 1e.</p><br>
              
              <h3>What's Different From Starfinder</h3>
              <p>In the original Starfinder, magic was prevalent, and gods and demons were real. Star's Edge has these things removed. Faith is merely belief, Magic is either folk healing, advanced technology, or (in the case of Solarian's) harnessing the universe.</p><br>
              <p>Another major change is the removal of the Gap. In the original Starfinder, the Gap was a period in which nobody remembers, and nothing was recorded. It was a way to explain the time gap between Pathfinder 1e and Starfinder, and gloss over the creation and deletion of specific settings within the universe. This was removed, as the lore has been altered to fit our reality more.</p><br>
              <p>The last notable change to Starfinder's world is that of scale. In the original game, many, many sentient species all lived in the same solar system. This was to the point of the entirety of the pact worlds being the same exact solar system. This has been altered to better reflect an exploration and isolation based mindset, and make the world not seem too crowded.</p>
              
              <h3>Worldbuilding</h3>
              <p>In the world of Star's Edge, there are many different sentient species. Some evolved naturally, some are artificial, and some may have been around since the beginning of the universe. Of the species present, 16 are playable, and there are countless non-playable ones. </p>

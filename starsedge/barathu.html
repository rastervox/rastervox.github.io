                    Note: Early Stage Barathu are Playable, Late Stage are Not. This a balance and lore problem that not even Paizo have touched. I am not gonna nerf an entire species just because they made the late-stage versions too powerful lore-wise. I apologize for this inconvenience, and the numerous times that "early stage" must be added/included to these sections. — RasterVox

            <p>Barathus are the soaring, translucent, blimp-like sapients that colonize many gas giants in the Far Worlds. They bear a vague resemblance to jellyfish, and are capable of rewriting their own DNA, making them extremely flexible and adaptable.
              </p>
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Strange organisms who developed in the swirling storms of Bretheda, a large Far Worlds gas giant, the Barathu have an interesting physiology. They are a loose collective of cells, not too dissimilar to most multicellular organisms, with one exception: The cells that make up Barathu are autonomous, and can separate or join at will. This has resulted in some fascinating biological wonders, such as the joining of consciousnesses to create larger and more intelligent beings, synthesis of materials using the cellular organisms inside them, and the ability to rewrite their own genetic code to suit their purpose.
            </p><br>
            <p>Since barathus can rewrite their own genetics, ensuring biological diversity and repairing genetic damage, they have no need of sexual reproduction, which is less advantageous than simple budding. With sufficient resources, a barathu inclined to reproduce generates an excess of tissue and genetic material, which eventually splits off.
            </p><br>
            <p>Similarly, due to their genetic flexibility, Barathu do not age. Instead, an individual&#039;s psyche slowly falters as it accumulates more and more memories and repeatedly merges and disbands. In the process, the barathu loses the ability to maintain its genetic code. By this time, most barathus choose to contribute their bodies and lifetime of experiences to a permanently combined entity, except a few who choose to remain apart and die alone.
            </p><br>
            <p>Barathu have darkvision sight, vibrational hearing, and basic olfaction capabilities.
              </p>
            <h2>Appearance / Culture</h2>
            <p>Large jellyfish-like blobs of gas and flesh, early-stage barathus are typically 5 feet long and 200 lbs. Appearances of these strange beings are wildly varied, but all revolve around a gas-filled head bladder, and the long tendrils that fall from it. Fashion is simply not that prominent in Barathu society, due to the aformentioned problem of individuality inherent with a being that can fully meld with other&#039;s of its own species.
                </p><br>
            <p>Despite this, there is some fashion among early-stage &quot;traveler&quot; barathu, that being the ability to change the colors and minor details of the Barathu&#039;s skin, resulting in interesting patterns and shapes taking form in difference cliques around the galaxy.
                </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Millions of years ago, single-celled organisms floating in the skies of Bretheda joined together into a new, larger, more adaptable and more capable being. Unlike what happened on other planets, however, the cells kept their autonomy and function, and retained the ability to join together or detach as they see fit. This adaptation, alongside the ability to rewrite their own genetic code at will, have long been a cornerstone of barathu society.
                </p><br>
            <p>For most of their history, barathus have had little need for formal government due to their peaceful nature and ability to merge, except when they have to overcome an immediate challenge. Left to their devices, barathus are usually content to sing and dance in the skies of Bretheda. When there is a conflict, they&#039;d merge and address it as a collective. Nevertheless, they saw the need of an overarching structure to prevent from falling into anarchy, leading those barathus who felt the call of public service to merge into Confluence, a hyperintelligent collective that governs Bretheda as a whole. Confluence&#039;s policies are usually liberal, providing social protections and wide personal freedoms while harshly punishing violent crime.
                </p><br>
            <p>Other species usually have a difficult time understanding barathus, as the concept of &#039;self&#039; is somewhat nebulous due to their frequent mergers. Barathus who grow up among humanoids tend to better appreciate the mindsets of creatures with static, solitary configurations, but have a difficult time merging with others due to their adaptation to humanoid mindsets. Most early stage barathus eventually grow out of this phase, but there has been an increasing number of those who do not, creating a significant cultural divide between &quot;travellers&quot; and &quot;residents&quot;.
                </p><br>
            <p>In a similar vein, Barathus do not use names among themselves, since they need no such designations with their powerful telepathy, and naming all of their unique personalities is too inefficient. When interacting with other species, barathus adopt names that resemble titles, describing the barathu&#039;s role and relationship to larger collectives. Barathus living entirely among others adopt personal names, with no consistent conventions. Barathus find their unique nature ordinary and rarely talk about it; in contrast, they struggle to understand the isolation of non-telepathic species and view them with both pity and condescension.
                </p><br>
            <p>Due to their unique traits of biological synthesis, when first contact with the Pact Worlds was established, barathus were (and still are) quite successful in the Pact Worlds economy, and their understanding of wealth and trade is largely influenced by this ability. Some barathus collectives operate corporations that facilitate interplanetary trade in biotechnology, a field dominated by them. The oldest barathus often permanently merge with massive conglomerates that serve as corporations, governments or cultural repositories.

                    <h4>Early Stage Adaptation</h4>
                    An early stage barathu’s body is mutable and can adapt to many different situations. Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, an early stage barathu can reshape its body and adjust its chemistry to gain one of the following qualities. The adaptation lasts until the beginning of the early stage barathu’s next turn. Unlike more mature barathus, early stage barathus are not generally capable of more complex adaptations.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upper limb refinements enable the barathu to add an additional amount of damage to melee attacks equal to its Strength modifier.</li>
                        <li>A toughened dermal layer grants its a +1 racial bonus to AC.</li>
                        <li>Developed lower limbs grant it a base speed of 15 feet.</li>
                        <li>Molecular-level modifications grant it resistance 2 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic).</li>
                        <li>Elongated limbs extend its reach to 10 feet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Floaters</h4>
                    Early stage barathus have a base speed of 0 feet and an extraordinary fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability.
                    <h4>Limited Telepathy</h4>
                    Early stage barathus can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language in common.
                    <h4>Strange Anatomy</h4>
                    Early stage barathus gain a +1 racial bonus to Fortitude saving throws.
                    <h4>Darkvision</h4>
                    Early stage barathus have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

                <li>Suspect you may know much more than you lead on, with how old and wise you likely are.</li>
